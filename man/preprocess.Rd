\title{Main preprocessing function for uploaded data}
\usage{
preprocess(data, metadata, is_sample = TRUE, is_aggregated = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame containing raw uploaded data.}

\item{metadata}{List containing analysis metadata including family type,
special cases, and time-varying flags.}

\item{is_sample}{Logical. Whether the data represents sample data. Default is TRUE.}

\item{is_aggregated}{Logical. Whether the data is already aggregated. Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
Preprocessed data frame ready for MRP analysis with:
\itemize{
  \item Cleaned and standardized column names
  \item Validated data structure and types
  \item Recoded demographic variables to expected levels
  \item Geographic variables appended at appropriate scales
  \item Time indices created for time-varying data
  \item Missing values imputed where appropriate
  \item Data aggregated if needed for modeling
}
}
\description{
Comprehensive preprocessing pipeline that cleans data, renames
columns, validates structure, handles aggregation, converts dates to time
indices, recodes values, imputes missing data, and appends geographic variables.
This is the main entry point for data preprocessing in the shinymrp package.
